its me stinko, i just decided that you could add in some screams if you wanted to.

look for the "random death thingy majiggy.lua" file in 3deez's folder, theres some values that you can change.
make sure to have the ogg name like this: "3die-#.ogg", replace the tag with the number that comes after the previous one.
